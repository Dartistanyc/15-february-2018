   <h1>Róisín Murphy</h1>
   <p><a href="...">Musically adventurous,</a> stylistically unique, and vocally smooth, Irish-born Róisín Murphy defined the 90s electronic scene, first with the group Moloko then as a solo artist. Backed by a group of jazz-inspired musicians and an army of electronic music’s top remixers, such as François K, Matthew Herbert, and Boris Dlugosch, Murphy has consistently released the kind of electronic music that is both unexpected and experimental. In a nutshell, Murphy’s the Radiohead of electronica, and the one who paved the way for people like Lady Gaga and Adele.</p>
